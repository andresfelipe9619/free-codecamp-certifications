                            Even though he was raised Catholic, Bob Marley showed interest in the Rastafari beliefs
                            while
                            he was away from his mother. When Marley moved back to Jamaica, he officially became a
                            Rastafarian and began to grow his dreadlocks, based on the biblical figure Samson and the
                            Rastafari belief against cutting hair.</p>

                            While with CBS records, Marley was on a UK tour with Johnny Nash. Nash introduced him to
                            Chris Blackwell who convinced Marley to sign with Island. The Wailers recorded Catch A Fire
                            with Island.</p>

                            Two days before a free concert organized by the Prime Minister of Jamaica, Marley, his wife,
                            and his manager were shot and wounded in a political assault. The show went on, with Marley

                            Shortly after moving to England, Marley and the Wailers recorded Exodus, Jammin, and People
                            Get Ready. While there, he was arrested for possession of a small quantity of cannabis and
                            convicted.</p>

                            Marley was diagnosed with a malignant melanoma on his toe. His religious beliefs, against
                            doctor’s orders, did not allow him to have his toe amputated. He continued touring with his
                            band, despite his illness.</p>

                            The Wailer’s hit song, “Redemption Song,” was released. It is rumored that this song was
                            about Marley coming to terms with his mortality. Shortly after touring for the album,
                            Marley’s health deteriorated.</p>

                            On a plane trip home from tour, Marley’s vital signs became worrisome. His melanoma has
                            spread to his brain and lungs and caused his death. His final words to Ziggy, the youngest
                            of twelve children, were, “Money can’t buy life.”</p>

                            Marley had a state funeral in Jamaica. He was buried with his red Gibson Les Paul. The
                            funeral combined elements of Ethiopian Orthodoxy and Rastafari traditions.</p>

                            A statue of Marley was inaugurated in Banatski, Serbia. Also, the State of New York renamed
                            a part of Church Avenue Bob Marley Boulevard.Bob Marley evolved into a global symbol of
                            rock, reggae, and Jamaican roots. He was a misunderstood man, worth far more than the legacy
